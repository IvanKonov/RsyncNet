Overloads or verified support for memory mapped views of files for hashgenerator, deltagenerator and deltastreamer

Implement an incremental hash of the entire file as sender processes its source file

Implement an incremental has of the entire file as recipient processes its reconstructed file

Verify that the written file is the same as the one on the sender's side

overloads for memory mapped files

SlidingStreamBuffer could possibly benefit from being made asynchronous

Verify long support (> 2GB)

HashBlockStreamer should be made independant of hashblock size (currently 16, which fits with md5)
